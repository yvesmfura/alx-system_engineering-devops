# Welcome to Web Infrastructure Design!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Web Infrastructure Design project! In this project, we explore various concepts and designs related to web infrastructure. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this project offers valuable insights into building robust web systems.

## Project Overview

This project is all about designing and understanding different types of web infrastructure setups. From simple one-server setups to distributed architectures, we cover it all. Each task presents a unique scenario, challenging you to think critically about system design principles and best practices.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack

In this task, you'll design a basic web infrastructure using a single server. You'll set up a web server, application server, and database to host a website reachable via www.foobar.com. This task introduces fundamental concepts like servers, DNS, and system redundancy.

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

Task 1 expands on Task 0 by designing a more complex web infrastructure using multiple servers. You'll incorporate load balancing and database replication to improve scalability and reliability. This task delves into topics like load balancing algorithms, high availability, and database clustering.

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

Task 2 focuses on security and monitoring aspects of web infrastructure. You'll add firewalls, SSL certificates, and monitoring tools to ensure your system is secure, serves encrypted traffic, and can be effectively monitored. This task addresses issues like SSL termination, database write availability, and server component diversity.

### Task 3: Scale Up (Advanced)

The final task challenges you to scale up your infrastructure while maintaining performance and reliability. You'll split components across multiple servers and configure load balancers for optimal traffic distribution. This task explores the differences between application and web servers and emphasizes the importance of thoughtful infrastructure design.

## Conclusion

We hope this project provides valuable insights into web infrastructure design and prepares you to tackle real-world challenges in web development. Get ready to dive in and level up your skills!
